[![AOC_2022](https://github.com/kampanosg/advent-of-code-22/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kampanosg/advent-of-code-22/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

The Advent of Code 2022 challenges, written in Rust.

## How to Use
Each day's challenge is located in its own subdirectory (e.g. `day1/`, `day2/`, etc.). Within each directory, you will find a Rust source file (`main.rs`) that contains the solution to the challenge. Every challenge comes in two parts (e.g. `p1` and `p2`). The `main` function expects the user to pass the part they want to run as a command line argument.

To run a particular day's solution, navigate to the corresponding directory and run the following command:

```sh
cargo run -- input.txt p1
```

Where `input.txt is the input data provided for the challenge. The solution will be printed to the console.

### Testing
Some challenges have unit tests. These can run with the following command:
```sh
cargo test
```

## Dependencies
The only external dependency required to run these solutions is Rust.

## Disclaimer
These solutions were written for fun and education as I wanted to get better at Rust. Therefore, they may not be the most efficient or elegant solutions possible as I was learning on the go!
